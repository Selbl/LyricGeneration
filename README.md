# LyricGeneration

This repository contains the steps necessary to generate lyrics using a finetuned GPT2 model. There are three notebooks, each dealing with different parts of the process:

- Fetching lyrics from the Genius API
- Training the model
- Lyric generation

## Disclaimers

The code generates lyrics based on the lyrics from over 7,000 songs (mostly from the rock genre). I am not responsible for any offensive phrases or words that the model can output.

Because I can't upload files of over 25MB to my repository, I have made the model weights and the csv with the song lyrics available from my Google Drive at the following links:
